Every district and every school takes a different path in the transition from traditional to modern schools. There are different entry points. There are different school-community dynamics. There are different levels of trust and school improvement experiences. There are different roll-out strategies. <br>

To prepare for the journey, take the time to get a sense of the landscape. Ask your peers at other schools which missteps they took and how they corrected for it. There will be missteps and its important to engage people early in understanding that it is helpful to raise attention to problems so that they can be corrected. <br>

The following questions are designed to help you reflect on a number of key capacities that will need to be developed in your school. You’ll notice that there isn’t a section on technology. Consider technology and other tools as ways to support and strengthen your school, not as a solution itself. You may also find the book Quality Principles for Competency-Based Education to be helpful in thinking about the landscape you might encounter as you begin the change process.
